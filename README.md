Although most people probably that [Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_chess) is an ancient game, compared to all the other board games on this list, it is relatively young. While the exact origins of Chess are unknown, most historians agree that the game originated in India during the Gupta Empire around the 6th century AD — some historians believe it originated in China.

The early form of the game from India was called chaturanga, which featured “four divisions of the military”: infantry, cavalry, elephantry, and chariotry — these game pieces eventually evolved into the modern-day pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.

Like many early games, the rules of Chess evolved as it spread throughout the world, and the modern rules of the game were formed around the 15th century in Europe.

The game of [Nine Men’s Morris](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/11/02/nine-mens-morris-is-one-of-the-worlds-most-ancient-games/) is so old that no one knows for sure when and where exactly the game originated. One of the earliest known boards for the game was found “cut onto the roofing slabs of the temple at Kurna in Egypt” dating to around 1400 BCE. However, there is some disagreement over the age of the temple’s slabs.

The game was popular in Ancient Rome as there are many boards carved into Roman buildings, but boards are hard to date due to the buildings’ exposure. Nine Men’s Morris spread across Europe and was a popular game among priests and monks.

Nine Men’s Morris is still widely played today and its rules have not changed much since they were first recorded.

[Go](https://www.britgo.org/intro/history), known as Weiqi in its country of origin China, is one of the oldest board games in the world that is still largely popular today.

The popularity of Go grew throughout other East Asian countries, especially Japan (which is where the name Go comes from), where the most significant advances in the game’s play were made during the 1670s.

Other similar boards of 20 squares have been found at other ancient sites in Egypt, such as Tutankhamen’s tomb, and India.

Historians were able to reconstruct the games rules based on a partial cuneiform tablet from Babylon dating from 177 – 176 BCE.

[Backgammon](http://www.backgammon-play.net/History.htm) is another ancient game that is even older than Chess.

In 2004, archaeologists discovered a gameboard in the ancient city of Shahr-e Sukhteh in Iran resembling the game of Backgammon. The board was dated to around 3000 BCE and is believed to be the oldest Backgammon board ever found. It is made of ebony and features sixty markers made of turquoise and agate, as well as a pair of dice.

The game’s rules changed as it was played in different countries and the oldest game with rules almost identical to modern Backgammon was called “tabula” from the Byzantine Empire in Greece dating back to around 480 AD.
