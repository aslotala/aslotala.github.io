## Additional Information about 4. Mehen

Mehen is an ancient Egyptian board game that dates back to around 3000 BCE, making it one of the oldest known board games in history. The game is named after the serpent god Mehen, who was associated with protection and the afterlife.

The game board is typically circular, resembling a coiled snake, and features a series of spaces or squares along its length. Players would use pieces, often shaped like lion or other animal figures, to navigate the board. The objective of the game is believed to involve moving pieces along the path and possibly capturing opponents' pieces, although the exact rules are not definitively known due to the lack of surviving written instructions.

Mehen was likely played by the elite of ancient Egyptian society and may have had religious or symbolic significance, reflecting themes of life, death, and the journey to the afterlife. Archaeological finds, including game boards and pieces, have been discovered in tombs, indicating its importance in ancient Egyptian culture.
