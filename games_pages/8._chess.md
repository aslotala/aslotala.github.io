## Additional Information about 8. Chess

Chess is a two-player strategy board game that has been played for centuries and is known for its deep tactical and strategic elements. The game is played on an 8x8 square board, with each player controlling 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. 

The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means putting it in a position where it cannot escape capture. Each type of piece moves in a unique way:

- **King**: Moves one square in any direction.
- **Queen**: Moves any number of squares in any direction.
- **Rook**: Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
- **Bishop**: Moves any number of squares diagonally.
- **Knight**: Moves in an "L" shape (two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular).
- **Pawn**: Moves forward one square but captures diagonally; on its first move, it can move forward two squares.

Chess is not only a game of skill but also a rich cultural and intellectual pursuit, with a vast literature on strategy, tactics, and openings. It has a competitive scene with tournaments held worldwide, and it is recognized as a sport by the International Olympic Committee. The game has also inspired numerous variations and adaptations, including online platforms and computer chess engines.
