## Additional Information about 7. Nine Men’s Morris

Nine Men’s Morris is a traditional board game that has been played for centuries, with origins tracing back to ancient Rome. The game is played on a board with a grid of 24 points, where players aim to form "mills"—three of their pieces in a row—while also trying to block their opponent.

### Basic Rules:
1. **Setup**: Each player starts with nine pieces (often referred to as "men"). Players take turns placing their pieces on the board's points.
2. **Forming Mills**: When a player places three of their pieces in a row along a line, they form a mill and can remove one of their opponent's pieces from the board.
3. **Movement**: After all pieces are placed, players take turns moving their pieces to adjacent points. The goal remains to form mills while preventing the opponent from doing the same.
4. **Winning the Game**: A player wins by reducing their opponent to two pieces, making it impossible for them to form any more mills.

### Strategy:
- Players must balance between forming their own mills and blocking their opponent's attempts to do so.
- Strategic placement and movement of pieces are crucial, as controlling the center of the board can provide more options for forming mills.

Nine Men’s Morris is not only a game of strategy but also one of foresight, as players must anticipate their opponent's moves while planning their own. The game is simple to learn but can be quite complex in terms of strategy, making it appealing to players of all ages.
