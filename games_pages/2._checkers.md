## Additional Information about 2. Checkers

Checkers, also known as draughts, is a classic board game played on an 8x8 square board, typically with two players. Each player starts with 12 pieces, usually in contrasting colors (commonly black and red). The objective of the game is to capture all of the opponent's pieces or block them so they cannot make a move.

### Basic Rules:
1. **Setup**: The board is positioned so that each player has a dark square in the bottom left corner. Players place their pieces on the three rows closest to them on the dark squares.

2. **Movement**: Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally forward to an adjacent unoccupied dark square. 

3. **Capturing**: If an opponent's piece is adjacent to a player's piece and there is an empty square immediately beyond it, the player can "jump" over the opponent's piece, capturing it. The captured piece is then removed from the board.

4. **King Pieces**: When a piece reaches the opponent's back row, it is "kinged" and typically stacked with another piece of the same color. Kings can move both forward and backward diagonally.

5. **Winning the Game**: The game ends when one player captures all of the opponent's pieces or blocks them from making any legal moves.

Checkers is a game of strategy and tactics, requiring players to think ahead and anticipate their opponent's moves. Variations of the game exist, including different board sizes and rules, but the fundamental gameplay remains similar.
